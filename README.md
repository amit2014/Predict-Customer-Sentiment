# Predict-Customer-Sentiment
In today's competitive world where Airline companies are struggling to maintain their margin, it becomes imperative to not only add a new set of customers to the portfolio but equally important is retaining the customer loyalty. Understanding your current customer reaction to the services is key to maintaining a healthy relationship.  
The team will capture the customer feedback shared on Twitter about the flying experience of recent time which company wants to understand and act upon. Any negative sentiment has to be identified on a near real-time basis, and customer should be reached out to understand the problem and also get themes around complaints to put in place a strategic plan.


Problem:
In the present world, there is no in-built system in place to find whether customer's feedback is positive or negative or neutral. 


Solution:
Build a classification model to decide whether it is a positive or negative or neutral category. Also, build a system to understand themes around the customer's feedback.   
The data has the feedback of different airlines; feel free to use all data and show sentiments across operators.
